# OpenTok Screen Sharing Accererator Pack

This package provides an easy way to get started in implementing interoperable screen sharing using the OpenTok platform.  For usage details, take a look at the [Screen Sharing Annotation Sample App](https://github.com/opentok/screensharing-annotation-acc-pack/tree/master/JS).


###Installation:

```bash
$ npm install --save opentok-annotation
```

If using browserify or webpack:

```javascript
const screenSharing = require('opentok-screen-sharing');
```

Otherwise, include the accelerator pack in your html:

```html
<script src="../your/path/to/opentok-screen-sharing.js"></script>
```
 . . . and it will be available in global scope as `ScreenSharingAccPack`
