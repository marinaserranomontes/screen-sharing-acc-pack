# OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack<br/>Version 1.1

The OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack provides functionality you can add to your OpenTok applications. This functionality enables users to share an application window screen (not the device screen) from both mobile and browser-based devices.

With the OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack, you can:

- Initiate and manage screensharing features between two users, regardless of the devices they are using.
- Customize the UI features and layout.
- Create mobile apps for Android and iOS, or embed the interactive session between users into any website.

The OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack serves as a component in some of the sample apps, such as the [Screensharing with Annotations Sample App](https://github.com/opentok/one-to-one-screen-annotations-sample-apps). 

You can also add the OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack to your apps. To get started with your development, see:

- [OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack for Android](./android)
- [OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack for iOS](./ios)
- [OpenTok Screensharing Accelerator Pack for JavaScript](./js)

_**NOTE: The audio-video communication logic provided in all OpenTok One-to-One Communication Sample Apps is contained in the [OpenTok Common Accelerator Session Pack](https://github.com/opentok/acc-pack-common).**_
